Building on the work of others and in only 4 short months we organized a team of professionals from the local community to acts as mentors in a capture the flag computer security training/competition for ~20 kids.    
###Onsite this what the kids had to say

`I felt that the mentor-based approach worked well.  It is really fun and I like it.`

	"I was able to understand everything going on.  We moved at a pace I could follow.  There were people to help me when I needed it.  Everything was interesting & informational.  I have learned a lot and believe it has and will help me."  

`Perfect.  Longer.  More time.`  
	
	Everyone did an excellent job of making sure no one fell behind, while still allowing all the others to continue at their own pace.

###Community mentors had this to say

`"It was of the most awesome things I have ever experienced ...  Now that there is incredible momentum and hype I think we have a duty, Nay, an obligation to help these kids continue somehow or somewhere."`  

	"This weekend we trained twenty.   What kind of a world would we live in if we could influence 200, 2,000 or 20,000 young students to become interested in programming and security?"
